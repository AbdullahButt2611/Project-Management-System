# Project-Management-System
Contains code related to my Mid Term Project whose title is "Project Management System". 

## Description
This project is all about a simple application which is created to manage the Final-Year series along with the evaluation of the relative students and making their groups. Keep in mind that **this system is not portable** as **no database** has been used in this system. What the features of this system are is, the user are distributed into two actors. One is for the students and the other is for the admmins. The students can simply look for their evaluation or assigned tasks. And after the deadline, they can check their grades or marks. On the other hand the teachers can simply go for the evaluation and then check for the studejnts status also they can resticate or cancel someone's project etc.

### Note
> This Project needs JCalender.jar File to get ready for execution also, The Project needs Netbeans like IDE for their proper application.
